<P>The Font Validator generates Pass messages, Errors messages, Warnings, and Informational notes.</BR></BR>
<B>Pass</B><BR>
A Pass message indicates that the font has passed a specific test, as indicated by the text of the message.<BR><BR>
<B>Errors</B><BR>
Errors indicate that there is a structural or functional problem with the font. The file may be corrupted or have been built in a way that will cause problems and unexpected behavior for font clients.<BR><BR>
<B>Warnings</B><BR>
The Validator generates Warnings when something is found in the font that is inconsistent with Microsoft recommendations or may potentially cause problems. Issues labelled as Warnings may not prevent the font from working with current or previous Windows operating systems, but may compromise the usefulness of the font in the future. <BR><BR>
<B>Information</B><BR>
Informational notes identify which tables were not chosen for testing; and flag minor issues or inconsistencies.<BR><BR><BR>
